# 🏋️ Gym Member Dropout Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes gym member behavior to understand **why users drop out** and how gyms can reduce churn using data-driven insights.

## 🎯 Objective
- Identify key behavioral and demographic factors behind member dropout
- Distinguish between **preventable** and **unavoidable** churn
- Provide actionable business recommendations

## 📊 Dataset Description

- Key features:
  - Age, Gender
  - Sessions per week, Average session duration
  - Progress score, Mood after workout
  - Injury status

  - Dropout (target variable)

## 🔍 Key Insights

- Younger and mobile users are more likely to drop out due to location mismatch
- Low engagement and poor progress visibility strongly correlate with dropout
- Injury significantly increases churn probability

## 💼 Business Recommendations
- Open gyms near IT hubs, colleges, and rental zones
- Introduce branch transfer memberships to reduce relocation churn
- Improve trainer engagement and progress tracking
